This is a clone of the popular news/blog site, Medium.com, generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

## Project Goals

1 Medium.com Front Page - Complete Copy
  - cloned site should be almost visually identicle
  - working nav bar that routes to a collection of articles in the selected category
  - featured HERO article section that filters through 'featured' articles, selected by an admin(see below)
  - main content section featuring article list and an aside
2 Admin Dashboard Component
  - non-gated component where new articles may be written, and all articles may be edited with new tags, or featured status.
3 Article View Component
  - all article cards link to a Full View component
  - article view looks and functions like Medium.Com article

Stretch Goals:
- Article Responese Component
- Sub Magazine/ Category Components (some Medium categories have uniqe collection pages/sub home pages)
- Clap System

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
